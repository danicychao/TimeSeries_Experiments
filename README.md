# TimeSeries_Experiments
The ultimate goal is to build a LLM model to analyse [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/321/electricityloaddiagrams20112014) like [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11939). Before that, we can still conduct some traditional time-series analysis to have some insights about the datase. This is an ongoing project.

### TimeSeries_101

Some very first steps tackling time series. For the dataset of electricity use, we can use these very first steps to see the electricity use in different week days or in different months, which is useful for further behaviour analysis. In this notebook, we can also see how to apply the gold standard models, such as ARIMA and SARIMA, to fit time series.
